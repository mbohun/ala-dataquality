"There could be a suite of test based on the example at right (from Australian Museum):
Our entomology staff have been reviewing georeference information in EMu. They found that the Lat Long was wrong for K244722 The following info was identified by the ento staff member: “irn 1061424 has Australia, New South Wales, Blackheath Creek (32° 09' 25"" S, 149° 16' 05"" E)
There are two lat/long possibilities:

Blackheath Creek NSW Official-32 9 149 16
Blackheath CreekNSWOfficial-33 37 150 15

I am going to change that site record to the second pair.
I think it was a case of a data enterer picking the first one in the Gaz. I searched for the same collector (F.T. Fricke) around same date (Dec 1982). There
are 138 Catalogue records, pretty much all from the Blue Mts. The first pair of lat/longs are way out west near Dunedoo. The second are near
Blackheath.” And so they changed the records lat long in Emu to “ K.244722 - Castiarina variopicta (Thomson, 1878) - New South Wales, Blackheath Creek , (33 37' S , 150 15' E), 27 Dec 1982”"
